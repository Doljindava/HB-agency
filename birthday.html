            <h3>Happy birthday!!!!</h3>
            <p>Funny how things can change. When we were in 8th grade I remember Nomin texting me saying that she was gonna stay up late just to text you happy birthday. At the time I thought it was so silly and why would anyone need to stay up so late just to sent them a silly text. But now I seem to get it. You are the most unexpected person to be in my life right now.  </p>
            <p>For the past two months I have got to know you far better than I have ever wished before. To tell the truth I always wanted to be closer to you as I didnt want us to be mutuals forever. A part of me wanted us be closer but ig I never really acted upon the impulse.   </p>
            <p>Being with you have made me the happiest I have ever been in a while. Although I may not say it as often to you but you make me happy . I am glad you were born on this day. And that I get to celebrate this day with you in a odd way. I am pretty upset that i didnt get to be there in person with you but I hope this little gesture will cheer you up. </p>
            <P>Now if you may thy princess shall choice thier present on this momentous occasion.</P>
